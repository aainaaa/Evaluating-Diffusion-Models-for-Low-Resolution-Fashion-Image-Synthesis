# Evaluating-Diffusion-Models-for-Low-Resolution-Fashion-Image-Synthesis
This project explores the use of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for generating low-resolution fashion images using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative models for simple yet structured image generation tasks, such as clothing categories.
